# User Management UI Improvements

## Problem Solved
Previously, when editing a user at the bottom of a long list, users had to scroll all the way back to the top to see and use the edit form. This created a poor user experience, especially with large user lists.

## Solution Implemented
Created `UserManagementSectionV2` with the following improvements:

### 1. **Modal Dialogs for Add/Edit**
- Both add and edit operations now use modal dialogs
- Forms appear immediately on screen without scrolling
- Users maintain their position in the list
- Clear visual focus on the task at hand

### 2. **Enhanced List View**
- Added search functionality to quickly find users
- Added type-based filtering (All, Mentees, Mentors, Coordinators)
- Shows user count for current filter
- Better visual indicators for user types with color coding

### 3. **Improved List Items**
- Each user now shows:
  - Avatar with first letter of name
  - Name with type badge
  - Email and Student ID (if available)
  - Edit and Delete action buttons
- Color-coded badges for user types:
  - Blue for Mentees
  - Green for Mentors
  - Orange for Coordinators
  - Purple for Developers

### 4. **Better Form Layout**
- Responsive design that adapts to screen size
- Organized sections: Basic Information and Additional Information
- Better field grouping and visual hierarchy
- Loading states on form submission
- Improved validation with clear error messages

### 5. **Additional Features**
- Fixed-height scrollable list with visible scrollbar
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Loading indicators
- Success/error notifications
- Segmented button filters for quick filtering

## Technical Changes

### Files Created
- `/lib/screens/web/shared/web_settings/sections/user_management_section_v2.dart`

### Files Modified
- `/lib/screens/web/shared/web_settings_v2/views/user_management_view.dart`
  - Updated to use `UserManagementSectionV2`
  - Simplified state management (removed form state variables)

## Benefits
1. **No more scrolling** to edit users
2. **Faster workflow** with modal dialogs
3. **Better organization** with search and filters
4. **Clearer visual hierarchy** with improved list items
5. **More intuitive** user experience overall

## Usage
The improved UI is automatically active in the new settings dashboard. Users will experience:
- Click edit → Modal appears immediately
- Make changes → Save or Cancel
- Modal closes → Return to exact position in list

No scrolling required!
