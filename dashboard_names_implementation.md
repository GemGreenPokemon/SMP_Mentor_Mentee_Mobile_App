# Dashboard Name Display Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of dynamic user name display in dashboard headers across the SMP Mentor-Mentee Mobile App.

## Changes Made

### 1. Mentor Dashboard (lib/screens/mentor_dashboard_screen.dart)
- Modified AppBar title from simple Text widget to Column widget
- Added mentor name display using: `mentorService.mentorProfile['name']`
- Fallback to 'Mentor' if name is not available
- Styled with fontSize: 14 and normal font weight

### 2. Mentee Dashboard (lib/screens/mentee_dashboard_screen.dart)
- Modified AppBar title from simple Text widget to Column widget  
- Added mentee name display using: `menteeService.menteeProfile['name']`
- Fallback to 'Mentee' if name is not available
- Styled with fontSize: 14 and normal font weight

### 3. Web Mentor Dashboard (lib/screens/web_mentor_dashboard_screen.dart)
- Updated sidebar profile section to use dynamic name
- Changed from hardcoded 'Sarah Martinez' to `Consumer<MentorService>`
- Uses `mentorService.mentorProfile['name']` with 'Mentor' fallback

### 4. Web Mentee Dashboard (lib/screens/web_mentee_dashboard_screen.dart)
- Updated sidebar profile section to use dynamic name
- Changed from hardcoded 'John Smith' to `Consumer<MenteeService>`
- Uses `menteeService.menteeProfile['name']` with 'Mentee' fallback
- Added missing import for MenteeService

## How It Works

1. When in test mode, `TestModeManager` provides `currentTestMentor` and `currentTestMentee`
2. `MentorService` and `MenteeService` load user data from `TestModeManager`
3. Services expose `mentorProfile` and `menteeProfile` getters with user info
4. Dashboards access the name via these service getters
5. Falls back to mock data if not in test mode

## Testing Instructions

1. Run the app and login as Developer
2. Select test users (mentor and mentee) from local database
3. Navigate to mentor/mentee dashboards
4. Verify that selected user names appear in the AppBar/sidebar

## Implementation Status
âœ… Complete - Dashboard name display is now dynamic and responds to test mode user selection
